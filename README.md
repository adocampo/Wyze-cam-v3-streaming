# How to install the RTSP Firmware
Download the Wyze Cam v2 RTSP file, the Wyze Cam v3 RTSP file, or the Wyze Cam Pan RTSP file. Please note that the Wyze Cam Pan firmware file is not compatible with Wyze Cam Pan v2.
For Wyze Cam v2 and Pan, unzip the file and rename the contents to 'demo.bin'. Then transfer the files to a microSD card's root directory. For Wyze Cam v3, transfer the ‘demo_wcv3.bin’ file to a microSD card's root directory
Unplug your Wyze Cam and insert the prepared microSD card.

Hold the camera's Setup button while plugging in the USB cable and continue to hold the Setup button until the light turns solid blue for Wyze Cam v2 and Pan or purple for Wyze Cam v3.

Once the light is solid blue, release the Setup button and wait for 3-4 minutes. The camera will reboot, and the status light will change during this time.

Note: The "Solid Blue" in this case is not the same as the one normally seen on the cameras. It would be lighter and yellowish on Wyze Cam v2 and Pan and purple on Wyze Cam v3.

Once this process is finished, you should see the Wyze Cam in your Home tab without going through the setup process as long as it was previously paired with your account.

Click “Generate URL”, and the RTSP URL will show on the next screen. Use this for streaming through any RTSP compatible player on the same local network as the Wyze Cam.
